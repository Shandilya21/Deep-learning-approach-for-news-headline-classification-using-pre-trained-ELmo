# word2vec_elmo
Word vector representation using Pre trained Elmo Model
This Model designed for word embedding from Deep Contextual representation of Language Model. Here we introduced a model that 
will generate a word embedding by looking into the context.

Requirements and packages/LibrarY:
* Python 3.5+
* Tensorflow
* Keras 
* Numpy
* Pandas

Here we take 'News Headline' and its 'Category' along with its short description, so that the words are relatable with the headline. First we have to 
classify on the basis of Headline and Short description and then qwe have created word embedding and trainable on the bags if words which undergo training.
