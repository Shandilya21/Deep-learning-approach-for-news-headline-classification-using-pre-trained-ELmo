# word2vec_elmo
Word vector representation using Pre trained Elmo Model
This Model designed for word embedding from Deep Contextual representation of Language Model. Here we introduced a model that 
will generate a word embedding by looking into the context.

Requirements and packages/Library:
* Python 3.5+
* Tensorflow
* Keras 
* Numpy
* Pandas

Here we take 'News Headline' and its 'Category' along with its short description. Here we need to classify the Headline based on its Category. There are total 22 catedory like "Entertainment","Politics","Sports" etc. Along with that Short description for formatting the headline and defining the headline properly.
